# Crowdsourcing and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)

# History

The Non-Authoritative Data (NAD) Ad Hoc meetings have come about as a result of common interests expressed by the following Domain Working Groups (DWGs) in December 2017 (Palmerston North):
- Citizen Science DWG
- Data Quality DWG

Rather than creating another OGC working group, the co-chairs of these working groups agreed to support the activity as a collaboration between them.

# Repository Purpose

This GitHub repository contains documents created as outputs from this activity. This may include discussion papers, best practices, etc., that can be presentation to various DWGs and Standards Working Groups (SWGs).
